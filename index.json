Based on candidate surveys from German state elections, we demonstrate that i.) attacks are an important strategy in (subnational) election campaigns; ii.) on balance, candidates regard attacking opponents as a costly instead of a beneficial strategy; iii.) the differential between benefits and costs is positively associated with attack behavior; nevertheless, most candidates attack even when costs exceed benefits; iv.) candidate profiles and the constraints under which candidates campaign are rarely reflected in benefit-cost calculations; v.) the suggested mediating role of the benefit-cost differential on attack behavior is definitely not the rule. Our results challenge the fundamental assumption that the decision to 'go negative' is primarily based on rational choice. The findings have implications for conceptualizing and measuring negative campaigning and provide avenues for further research.","tags":null,"title":"Are candidates rational when it comes to negative campaigning?

Such inauthentic information campaigns threaten to undermine the Internet's promise to more equitable participation in public debates. We argue that the logic of social behavior within the campaign bureaucracy and principal-agent problems lead to detectable activity patterns among the campaign's social media accounts. Our analysis uses a network-based methodology to identify such coordination patterns in all campaigns contained in the largest publicly available database on astroturfing published by Twitter. On average, 74% of the involved accounts in each campaign engaged in a simple form of coordination that we call co-tweeting and co-retweeting. Comparing the astroturfing accounts to various systematically constructed comparison samples, we show that the same behavior is negligible among the accounts of regular users that the campaigns try to mimic. As its main substantive contribution, the paper demonstrates that online political astroturfing consistently leaves similar traces of coordination, even across diverse political and country contexts and different time periods. The presented methodology is a reliable first step for detecting astroturfing campaigns.","tags":null,"title":"Coordination patterns reveal online political astroturfing across the world","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lennart Schürmann","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641049063,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641049063,"objectID":"6c37be4c61a1521a63cf72b8c762d793","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/schuermann-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schuermann-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Members of parliament (MPs) are elected via two different tiers in mixed-member electoral systems –- as winners of a seat in a constituency or as party candidates under proportional rules. While previous research has identified important consequences of this 'mandate divide' in parliaments, questions remain how this institutional setup affects MPs' political behavior in other arenas. Analyzing more than one million social media posts, this paper investigates regional representation in the online communication of German MPs. The results show that MPs elected under a direct mandate refer approximately twice as often to their constituencies by using regionalized wording and geographic references than MPs elected under the proportional tier. The substantive findings provide new evidence for the benefits of mixed-member electoral systems for political representation while the methodological approach demonstrates the added value of social media data for analyzing the political behavior of elites.","tags":null,"title":"Who represents the constituency?

Instead, these people report to pursue a passive mode of relying on specific sources, such as social media, based on the belief that 'news finds me' (NFM). Notably, the three subdimensions of NFM -- feeling informed, relying on peers, and not actively seeking news — combine intentions and perceptions related to news use. Understanding NFM perceptions, hence, requires an analytical distinction between active and passive modes of news use as reliable measures of (different types of) news use. We contribute to this field by combining a survey, tracked web-browsing data, and tracked Facebook data to investigate the relationship between NFM perceptions and exposure to online news, also taking into account political knowledge and interest as traditional predictors of active news consumption. Results show that both political knowledge and interest are associated with more news consumption via web browsers and that political knowledge—but not political interest—is also associated with more news in people’s Facebook feeds. Compared to the NFM dimensions, political knowledge and interest are stronger predictors of online news consumption in our study. Taken together, the novel combination of Facebook and web tracking data provides evidence that online news consumption is shaped by a confluence of traditional factors and more diffuse interpersonal processes.","tags":null,"title":"Do news actually 'find me'?

Combining panel surveys and online tracking data, the study explores candidate learning during the German 2019 EP election campaign and relates learning to different types of news exposure, with a special focus on online news. The results show that learning was limited and unevenly distributed across candidates. However exposure to candidate-specific online news and most types of offline news helped to acquire knowledge. The findings imply that *Spitzenkandidaten* stick to voters' minds when they get exposed to them, but that exposure is infrequent in high-choice media environments.","tags":null,"title":"Learning about the unknown Spitzenkandidaten: The role of media exposure during the 2019 European Parliament elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Frank Mangold","Michael Scharkow","Johannes Breuer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616252263,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616252263,"objectID":"be6f333933ad5f569cc7e9309a4624bb","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-2021-apsr/","publishdate":"2021-03-20T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-2021-apsr/","section":"publication","summary":"Online intermediaries such as social network sites or search engines are playing an increasingly central role in democracy by acting as mediators between information producers and citizens. Academic and public commentators have raised persistent concerns that algorithmic recommender systems would negatively affect the provision of political information by tailoring content to the predispositions and entertainment preferences of users. At the same time, recent research indicates that intermediaries foster exposure to news that people would not use as part of their regular media diets. This study investigates these unresolved questions by combining the web browsing histories and survey responses of more than 7,000 participants from six major democracies.

Deshalb wenden sich auch Politiker in Deutschland Plattformen wie Facebook und Twitter zu, um Wähler zu erreichen. Die akademischen Studien zum deutschen Fall beschränken sich allerdings bis auf wenige Ausnahmen auf die Online-Aktivitäten und Netzwerke von Politikern, ohne einen (über deren Parteizugehörigkeit hinausgehenden) systematischen Konnex mit bekannten Bestimmungsfaktoren für Kampagnenaktivitäten aus der 'Offline-Welt' herzustellen. Zudem dienten als Datengrundlage lediglich kleinere Samples von Accounts der Bundesparteien bzw. der Spitzenkandidaten oder selbstselektierte Teilnehmende an Kandidatenbefragungen. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Nutzung der beiden Online-Netzwerke mit der höchsten Relevanz in der politischen Kommunikation – Facebook und Twitter – durch sämtliche Kandidaten der großen deutschen Parteien für die Bundestagswahl 2017. Wir berücksichtigen als erklärende Variablen individuelle Charakteristika (z. B. Alter, Geschlecht), strukturelle Variablen (z. B.

Building on research on the European public sphere and the politicisation of the EU, this study investigates to what extent the 2019 EP campaign was transnational and which factors were associated with 'going transnational'. It conceptualises Twitter linkages of EP candidates as constitutive elements of a transnational campaign arena distinguishing interactions with EP candidates from other countries (horizontal transnationalisation) and interactions with the supranational European party families and lead candidates (vertical transnationalisation). The analysis of tweets sent by EP candidates from all 28 member states reveals that most linkages remain national. Despite this evidence for the second-order logic, there are still relevant variations contingent on EU positions of parties, the adoption of the Spitzenkandidaten system and socialisation in the EP. The findings have implications for debates on the European public sphere and institutional reform proposals such as transnational party lists that might mitigate the EU's democratic deficit.","tags":null,"title":"Going transnational?

Recent successes of populist parties and politicians, especially in Europe and in the US, have given rise to extensive debates in the academic literature and beyond. Yet the link between populism and climate change scepticism (henceforth ‘scepticism’), has so far received little attention. This paper examines the link between scepticism and populism by means of a unique dataset: a survey and detailed web browsing histories of participants from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the US, and the UK. The web tracking data includes more than 150 million website visits over a period of three months and the survey contains questions about political attitudes and attitudes towards climate change. We analyse the 8893 websites which contained ‘climate change’ and its cognates in the URLs and link these website visits and the content of these websites to the political attitudes and climate change orientation of those who visited them. The contribution is both methodological (linking surveys and web tracking data, including cross-country comparison) and substantive (uncovering links between populists, their climate change orientations, and the content of related websites they visited). Our analysis demonstrates the value of computational methods in political communication research and provides insights into the link between populists and climate change scepticism.","tags":null,"title":"Is there a link between climate change scepticism and populism?

We analyze the individual browsing histories of two representative samples of German Internet users collected in 2012 (N=2970) and 2018 (N=2045) and find robust evidence for a smaller generational gap in online news use than commonly assumed. While short news website visits mostly demonstrated infrastructural factors, longer news use episodes were shaped more by preferences. The infrastructural role of social media corresponded with reduced news avoidance and more varied news repertoires. Overall, the results suggest that research needs to reconsider commonly held premises regarding the uses of digital media in modern high-choice settings.","tags":null,"title":"The overstated generational gap in online news use?

Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to the overall news coverage. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets are selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice at a modest level. In the majority of news articles, tweets function as an illustration of an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and – with some dependencies – the amount of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper provides evidence how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.","tags":null,"title":"Twitter in the News: An analysis of embedded tweets in political news coverage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michaela Maier","Carlos Jalali","Jürgen Maier","Alessandro Nai","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"88569af9a7d0472336815da79820cd2a","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/maier-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-07T14:57:43.466505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maier-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"European elections have been described as second-order phenomena for voters, the media, but also parties. Yet, since 2009, there exists evidence that not only voters, but also political parties assign increasing significance to European elections. While initially 'issue entrepreneurs' were held responsible for this development, the latest campaigns have raised the question of whether mainstream parties are finally also campaigning on European issues. In this article, we examine European Union (EU) salience in the 2019 European Parliament (EP) campaigns of government and opposition parties and the predictors of their strategic behaviours. We test the relevance of factors derived from the selective emphasis and the co-orientation approach within an integrated model of strategic campaign communication based on expert evaluations of 191 parties in 28 EU member states. Results show that the traditional expectation that government parties silence EU issues does not hold anymore; instead, the average EU salience of government and opposition parties is similar on the national level. The strongest predictors for a party’s decision to campaign on EU issues are the co-orientation towards the campaign agendas of competing parties, and party's EU position.","tags":null,"title":"When do parties put Europe in the centre?

This may be surprising given the potential of linking surveys and digital trace data, but at the same time, it is important to note that the collection and analysis of such linked data are challenging in several regards. The three key issues are: (1) data linking including informed consent for individual-level studies, (2) methodological and ethical issues impeding the scientific (re)analysis of linked survey and digital trace data sets, and (3) developing conceptual and theoretical frameworks tailored toward the multidimensionality of such data. This special issue addresses these challenges by presenting cutting-edge methodological work on how to best collect and analyze linked data as well as studies that have successfully combined survey data and digital trace data to find innovative answers to relevant social scientific questions.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating Survey Data and Digital Trace Data: Key Issues in Developing an Emerging Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franziska Keller","David Schoch","Sebastian Stier","JungHwan Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c88f0f618724ecced10b7358cf7a0de2","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/keller-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.466182Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keller-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without 'ground truth' information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of campaign accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.","tags":null,"title":"Political Astroturfing on Twitter: How to Coordinate a Disinformation Campaign","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Nora Kirkizh","Caterina Froio","Ralph Schroeder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9d22c6c7aab85582926bced77b9ec5f1","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.466505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Research has shown that citizens with populist attitudes evaluate the news media more negatively, and there is also suggestive evidence that they rely less on established news sources like the legacy press. However, due to data limitations, there is still no solid evidence whether populist citizens have skewed news diets in the contemporary high-choice digital media environment. In this paper, we rely on the selective exposure framework and investigate the relationship between populist attitudes and the consumption of various types of online news. To test our theoretical assumptions, we link 150 million Web site visits by 7,729 Internet users in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to their responses in an online survey. This design allows us to measure media exposure more precisely than previous studies while linking these data to demographic attributes and political attitudes of participants. The results show that populist attitudes leave pronounced marks in people’s news diets, but the evidence is heterogeneous and highly contingent on the supply side of a country's media system. Most importantly, citizens with populist attitudes visit less Web sites from the legacy press, while consuming more hyperpartisan news. Despite these tendencies, the Web tracking data show that populist citizens still primarily get their news from established sources. We discuss the implications of these results for the current state of public spheres in democracies.","tags":null,"title":"Populist attitudes and selective exposure to online news – A cross-country analysis combining web tracking and surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Besondere Prominenz in dieser Debatte hat dabei die Hypothese sogenannter 'Echokammern' gewonnen, wonach digitale Medien ihre Nutzer darin bestärken, insbesondere solche Nachrichten zu beziehen, deren politische Positionierung sie teilen, und dadurch zu einer gesellschaftlichen Polarisierung beitragen. Während Echokammern in der öffentlichen Debatte zumeist unkritisch als gegeben betrachtet werden, wird das Konzept im wissenschaftlichen Diskurs zunehmend hinterfragt. Als Herausforderungen erweisen sich dabei eine schwache theoretische Aufarbeitung des Phänomens, ein stark zersplittertes Forschungsfeld und eine mangelnde Generalisierbarkeit von Forschungsergebnissen aufgrund des primären Fokus auf den US-amerikanischen Kontext. Der vorliegende Beitrag begegnet diesen Problemstellungen und gibt einen detaillierten Überblick über das Forschungsfeld. Der Literaturüberblick trägt dabei zur theoretischen Erfassung des Untersuchungsgegenstands bei, insbesondere durch eine explizite Differenzierung zwischen Fragmentierung und Polarisierung, und berücksichtigt außerdem länderspezifische Variationen. Insgesamt kommt dieser Überblick zu dem Schluss, dass die im öffentlichen Diskurs geäußerte Furcht vor einer gesamtgesellschaftlichen Fragmentierung und damit verbundenen politischen Polarisierung empirisch nicht unterstützt wird. So ist aufbauend auf die bisherige Forschung keine Fragmentierung öffentlicher Aufmerksamkeit entlang politischer Präferenzen feststellbar. Auch auf der Wirkungsebene der Polarisierung sprechen die bisherigen Erkenntnisse gegen die vereinfachten Annahmen der Echokammer-Hypothese. Dennoch sind die bisherigen wissenschaftlichen Befunde aufgrund von Limitationen im Datenzugang noch nicht umfassend genug. Der Beitrag verdeutlicht, dass die politische Kommunikationsforschung insbesondere von innovativen, extern validen Designs und komparativer Forschung außerhalb des US-Kontexts profitieren würde.","tags":null,"title":"Die Echokammer-Hypothese: Fragmentierung der Öffentlichkeit und politische Polarisierung durch digitale Medien?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Jungherr","Ralph Schroeder","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b7c5fb4d836887b7203be1f76722b51c","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/jungherr-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.467326Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jungherr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a recent surge of political actors and groups challenging the legitimacy of established political institutions and mass media. We argue that this wave is no accident; rather, it is driven by digital media. Digital media allow outside challengers to route around social institutions that structure political discourse, such as parties and legacy media, which have previously held a monopoly on political coordination and information distribution. Digital media have weakened the power of these institutions, allowing outsiders to maintain extreme positions that formerly would have been filtered out or suppressed by institutions structuring political discourse. In this article, we explicate mechanisms linking digital media to the rise of outsiders by discussing the successes of a diverse set of challengers fighting for attention and representation in the different political contexts of the United States, Germany, and China. We thus provide a novel explanation that systematically accounts for the political consequences of digital media.","tags":null,"title":"Digital media and the surge of political outsiders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Andreas Jungherr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a446ab72ee37102df9801b1385fc8107","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-jungherr-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-jungherr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Digitale Verhaltensdaten und Methoden der Computational Social Science in der politischen Kommunikationsforschung","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b30216cf02d033cafc8a95baa2725f86","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-2019-internet/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.461827Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-2019-internet/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Internetfreiheit in Europa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Becker","Marcus Müller","Wolf J.

Focusing on the German federal election campaign 2013, this article investigates whether election candidates address the topics most important to the mass audience and to which extent their communication is shaped by the characteristics of Facebook and Twitter. Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes. We relate the various findings to the mediation of political communication on social media induced by the particular characteristics of audiences and sociotechnical environments.","tags":null,"title":"Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Wolf J.

Studies suggest that NC can have dysfunctional consequences for democracy (e.g. polarization, declining trust in politics). This applies in particular to negative campaign strategies that attack an opponent personally or in an uncivil manner. However, the causes and effects of NC have rarely been analyzed outside of the United States. This project, jointly led with Jürgen Maier (University of Koblenz-Landau) and Corinna Oschatz (University of Amsterdam) investigates the determinants of the use of NC in German election campaigns at the federal and state level. The aim is to test explanatory factors at the micro level (politicians who use NC) and macro factors (structural conditions during election campaigns).\nFor this purpose, we first use self-reports from candidate surveys to investigate the use and evaluation of NC by candidates. We draw on the candidate studies conducted as part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) for the 2013, 2017 and 2021 federal elections. In addition, we will invite all candidates of the relevant political parties who will take part in all of the 2021 Landtag elections to a survey. In order to measure the actual use of NC, we collect the entire social media communication of candidates and hand code a high-quality training dataset that serves as the input for machine learning models for the detection of NC at a large scale. In contrast to established sources such as party manifestos, Twitter data is available at a more fine-grained level (of the individual candidate) and in larger numbers (hundreds of thousands of posts during an election campaign, in standardized form across parties). The results from the analysis of candidate surveys and social media will be linked on the level of individual candidates.\nTaken together, the project makes an essential theoretical and empirical contribution towards a better understanding of the determinants of NC (1) over time, (2) at different federal levels and (3) depending on different individual characteristics of politicians.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c9dd699c2b31e4084ec07050fab4a4b3","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/negative-campaigning/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/negative-campaigning/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (2021-2024)","tags":null,"title":"Negative Campaigning in German elections: Measurement, Dynamics, and Determinants","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary The online information environment provides citizens with an abundance of news and other content relevant for political opinion formation that varies considerably in terms of journalistic quality and political extremity. Politicians, journalists and academics have speculated that by facilitating individualized processes of opinion formation, the current high-choice environment of online news websites, social media and other information intermediaries is related to audience fragmentation and political polarization. Yet, research on the interplay of media exposure and dynamic polarization processes is sparse and at times contradictory. One of the reasons is that methods traditionally employed by social scientists to measure exposure such as survey-based self-reports inadequately capture online behavior.\nThis collaborative project with Katrin Weller (GESIS), Lisa Merten and Uwe Hasebrink (Leibniz-Institute for Media Research | Hans-Bredow-Institut), Juhi Kulshrestha and Cornelius Puschmann brings together techniques from computational social science with theories and methods from communication and political science. At its core is a year-long web tracking of a representative sample of approximately 1,500 German citizens from an online access panel. The participants are surveyed regularly on their demographics, political opinions, and media use and consent to having their visited websites tracked. Through web crawling and automated text analysis of those website contents we are able to measure the source, issue, and actor diversity of the information participants are exposed to and relate that to the development of their political opinions over time. With this longitudinal data, we systematically study the interplay between online information use and political opinions by statistically disentangling within-person changes. The findings have implications for academic and political debates on echo chambers, societal cohesion, and the regulation of online environments.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eb95e4c5b90612be8d26012a4e448556","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/poltrack/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/poltrack/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Leibniz Association (2022-2025)","tags":null,"title":"Political polarization and individualized online information environments: A longitudinal tracking study","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary During election campaigns, many of the political messages citizens receive are negative – be it via strategic negative campaigning, media coverage or uncivil online conversations. Many studies in political communication and psychology have already focused on the effects of negativity on citizens’ reactions, e.g., attention and emotions, evaluation of politicians, or voting behavior. Most of these studies, however, investigated citizens’ political communication in isolation focusing on just one channel. Studies that focus on effects of negative information received from mass media as well as interpersonal communication environments online and offline (in the following MIC), are to the best of our knowledge non-existent – despite the obvious interactions in terms of processes and effects.\nIn addition, most studies on negativity in campaigns either focus on traditional explanations of its effects on political outcomes through survey self-reports or they try to analyze the information processing of negative information, mostly within experimental designs. It has hardly been possible to observe the effects of negativity on fast-lived variables like attention and emotions in-situ and to analyze its effects on political outcomes in an integrated research design. As a consequence, the state of research regarding the overall impact of negative political communication on important political outcomes such as evaluation of political actors, voting behavior and affective polarization so far has been fairly inconclusive.\nIn this project, jointly led with Michaela Maier (University of Koblenz-Landau) and Lukas Otto (Amsterdam School of Communication Research), we aim to comprehensively analyze the effects of negativity in MIC during election campaigns to make a fourfold contribution to the state of research: First, we examine the dynamic exposure of citizens to negative political communication in various communication environments during an election campaign. Thereby, investigating the different communication types in one research design also allows us to analyze the reciprocal relations between mediated and interpersonal communication online and offline. Second, we analyze the short-term effects of negative contents on attentional and emotional processing, and third, longer-term effects on political outcomes. By taking a longitudinal perspective, we conceptualize and measure exposure to and effects of negativity during campaigns as dynamic processes. Fourth, we methodologically contribute to the state of research by using an innovative methodology that allows us to observe the aforementioned processes in a real-world setting: we combine approaches of offline and online tracking to continuously observe citizens' engagement in political communication, surveys to assess their short-term and long-term reactions, and automated content analysis to link participants' reactions to concrete communication contents. The study will be conducted during the hot phase of the German federal election campaign in September 2021.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a06fd2a832a32a342ef6a37cb60bce4d","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/web-track/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/web-track/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (2021-2024)","tags":null,"title":"Tracking the effects of negative political communication during election campaigns in online and offline communication environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary Scholars highlight several mechanisms of how digital media might benefit populists: (1) populist parties use digital media to bypass media gatekeepers that tend to obfuscate and filter their populist message; (2) social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter open up direct channels of communication between populist parties and voters/supporters, thereby bringing to life a core promise of the populist worldview; (3) social media are conducive to the spread of misinformation and disinformation that are core components in the communication strategies of populist parties; and (4) mainstream media amplify populist actors' online contents as they are reliable providers of scandals and have a massive news value.\nTogether with the other two PIs Caterina Froio (Sciences Po, Paris) and Ralph Schroeder (University of Oxford) and our respective teams, I test these theories using web browsing histories and multiple survey waves that were collected with the informed consent of more than 8,000 study participants in six countries. In addition, we collected the social media posts of a large sample of politicians and parties on Facebook and Twitter and conducted conjoint experiments. The research period captures the three months preceding the European Parliament (EP) election 2019 in six countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the U.S., which is the reference case in much of political communication research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"400022a1c007095bb693d3ef71523e13","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/online-populism/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/online-populism/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (2018-2022)","tags":null,"title":"What do 'the people' want?
