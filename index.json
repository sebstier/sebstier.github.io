Yet due to measurement problems and cross-country differences, recent research has been inconclusive regarding the prevalence of ideological self-selection into like-minded online news. We introduce a multi-method design combining the web-browsing histories and survey responses of more than 7000 participants from six major democracies with supervised text classification to separate political from nonpolitical news exposure. We find that political online news exposure is both substantially less prevalent and subject to stronger ideological self-selection than nonpolitical online news exposure, especially in the United States. By highlighting the peculiar role of political news content, the results improve the understanding of online news exposure and the role of digital media in democracy.","tags":null,"title":"Ideological self-selection in online news exposure: Evidence from Europe and the US","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cornelius Puschmann","Sebastian Stier","Patrick Zerrer","Helena Rauxloh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1717372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717372800,"objectID":"438b5775371847b414391eea41507f81","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/puschmann-2024/","publishdate":"2024-06-07T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puschmann-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"The study of right-wing alternative news sources has moved to the center of scholarly attention recently. Such sources cater to news consumers characterized by extreme political views and mistrust towards mainstream news. However, research into the predictors of alternative news consumption is still scarce. We approach this gap by combining online tracking and survey data from 2,009 German panel participants. We find conspiratorial thinking and pro-Russian stance to be predictors of alternative news consumption, both in absolute and in relative terms. Our analysis thus contributes to a more nuanced understanding of alternative news consumers.","tags":null,"title":"Politicized and paranoid?

Browsing data have characteristics that raise many questions for statistical analysis, yet to date, little hands-on guidance on how to handle them exists. Reviewing extant research, and exploring data sets collected through our four research teams spanning seven countries and several years, with over 14,000 participants and 360 million web visits, we derive recommendations along four steps typical for studies using browsing data: preprocessing the raw data; filtering out observations; classifying web vis- its; and modeling browsing behavior. We hope that the recommendations we formulate provides a foundation for discussions about best practices in the field, which so far has paid little attention to justifying the many analytical decisions typical for studies using browsing data.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of Web Browsing Data: A Guide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Schmidt","Frank Mangold","Sebastian Stier","Roberto Ulloa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1707264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707264000,"objectID":"a818e509c1a6257e24c4508ae85296c4","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/schmidt-2024/","publishdate":"2024-02-07T14:57:43.465789Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schmidt-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Given that Facebook is still the most widely used social networking site in the world, its influence on democratic processes is under constant scrutiny. Academics have put a special focus on Facebook's role in inhibiting or enhancing citizens' news exposure. Recent studies using digital behavioral data have analyzed the prevalence and effects of 'Facebook news referrals.' Using a web tracking tool that captures general browsing behavior as well as public posts seen on Facebook, this paper lays the groundwork for the field by assessing the validity of previously proposed operationalizations. We validate news referrals by investigating whether different measures actually reflect exposure to a news URL a user saw on Facebook. We furthermore assess the effects of news referrals on central outcomes in extant literature, contingent on different operationalizations. The results show that the most precise measure of news referrals are click identifiers attached to news URLs by Facebook. Different operationalizations of referrals have theoretically impactful consequences for the substantive understanding of Facebook's role in high-choice online environments. The paper demonstrates the need for academics to constantly innovate in order to measure citizens' online behavior in an ecologically valid manner.","tags":null,"title":"Facebook as an Avenue to News: A Comparison and Validation of Approaches to Identify Facebook Referrals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Schmidt","Sebastian Stier","Lukas Otto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1707264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707264000,"objectID":"edd05471151ad10f75724f34a7fa9fa4","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/schmidt-incivility-2024/","publishdate":"2024-02-07T14:57:43.465789Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schmidt-incivility-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Incivility, i.e., the breaking of social norms of conversation, is evidently prevalent in online political communication. While a growing literature provides evidence on the prevalence of incivility in different online venues, it is still unclear where and to what extent internet users are exposed to incivility. This paper takes a comparative approach to assess the levels of incivility across contexts, content and personal characteristics. The pre-registered analysis uses detailed web browsing histories, including public Facebook posts and tweets seen by study participants, in combination with surveys collected during the German federal election 2021 (N=739). The level of incivility is predicted using Google's Perspective API and compared across contexts (platforms and campaign periods), content features and individual-level variables.

While social media posts have been found to be of little deliberative quality, we do not know whether this also affects the deliberative quality of the news. Against the background of a hybrid media system and deliberative news media standards, we answer this research question with a content analysis of news articles including or not including posts from X (formerly Twitter) in the twelve widest-reaching German news websites prior and after the German general election 2021. We were particularly interested in the differences inside and outside election campaigns as the interdependence of the mass media and the political sphere is particularly pronounced during campaign periods. Results show that posts are more often cited and/or embedded in news articles inside than outside election campaigns. Articles including posts feature a greater number of actors but are not more diverse as mainly actors from the political center are referenced. Moreover, articles with posts are associated with a higher position responsiveness but on the other hand a decreased civility of the represented political discourse. This pattern only emerged inside but not outside campaign periods. These findings add to our understanding of contemporary hybrid media systems and the nature of political journalism during contentious political periods.","tags":null,"title":"Social media posts as source for political news coverage inside and outside election campaigns: Examining effects on deliberative news media quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marko Bachl","Elena Link","Frank Mangold","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"324d5b39b4a32c312bbfb83411056b15","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/bachl-2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-07T14:57:43.466505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bachl-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet searches for health-related purposes are common, with search engines like Google being the most popular starting point.

Both by themselves and in conjunction, the software tools open up new potentials for data collections, because they can capture media use across different online platforms and because they enable more thorough accounts of the dynamics of online media use than prevailing (survey) designs. At the same time, no software can capture each of the various facets of online media use and—importantly—the sustainable development and provision of research software is a complex and resource-intensive long-term endeavor. We address the technical and organizational measures taken by GESIS to provide scholars with sustainable access to the software tools and the associated data collection potentials.

While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. Scholars typically follow a two-stage procedure to obtain high prediction accuracy: manual content analysis followed by model training with human-annotated samples. We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis. Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses. A Krippendorff’s alpha of at least 0.8 is desirable to achieve satisfying prediction results after machine learning. Systematic errors (individual and joint) must be avoided at all costs. The best training samples were obtained using one coder per document or the majority coding curation strategy. Ultimately, this paper can help researchers produce trustworthy predictions when combining manual coding and machine learning.","tags":null,"title":"Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning: Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jürgen Maier","Corinna Oschatz","Sebastian Stier","Ingo Zettler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688688000,"objectID":"4f3bb4604c0b519875eadbad988f8581","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/maier-pers-2022/","publishdate":"2023-07-07T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maier-pers-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to explain the behavior of political elites, research increasingly considers personality traits. Within this line of research, a recent focus is on socially aversive -– yet non-pathological –- personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), with the idea to better understand behavior violating generally accepted ethical, moral, and social norms. Assessments of politicians’ aversive personality traits have so far been almost exclusively based on observer reports of experts and voters. Herein, by contrast, we introduce the Political Elites Aversive Personality Scale (*PEAPS*) particularly tailored to measure self-reported aversive personality among politicians. Based on two studies with German politicians, we develop a 6-item short scale comprising aspects of different socially aversive personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness). The scale shows an acceptable model fit, an acceptable internal consistency, an acceptable measurement equivalence, and meaningful correlations with other (self-reported) psychological traits and campaign behavior. Moreover, the scale significantly contributes to the explanation of candidates' negative campaigning, going beyond the explanatory power of models capturing broad, basic personality traits. Overall, the suggested scale provides interesting links to research in (political) psychology and can help to explain attitudes, behavior, and performance of political elites.","tags":null,"title":"A short scale to measure self-reported aversive personality in political elites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nora Kirkizh","Caterina Froio","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683471463,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683471463,"objectID":"8cc47f0c4b0a83788ca0738bc836af7f","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/kirkizh-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-07T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kirkizh-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The politics of representation has become increasingly complex in recent years. Amid weakening traditional political cleavages, the emergence of new political divides and mounting anti-elitism that have helped the rise of radical populist parties, voters face significant cross-pressures when casting their ballots. Despite a wealth of studies on the role of issue preferences in voting behavior, there are still many unknowns when it comes to understanding how voters trade off competing issue preferences against each other. Studying issue trade-offs is also important against the backdrop of the well-documented preference of radical left and right voters for redistribution and restrictive immigration policies, respectively. To investigate the strength of issue preferences among radical left, radical right and mainstream party voters and the willingness to compromise on their most important issues, we conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 2,000 participants in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The voting scenario in the experiment featured proposals on salient political issues and different (non)populist stances on political representation. The results from the cross-country study as well as a large replication study with a sample of 4,000 German respondents show that voters of radical right parties are willing to accept large trade offs regarding their other issue preferences as long as their preference for restrictive immigration policies is fulfilled. Differently, radical left, Green and mainstream party voters have a more variegated range of issue preferences, some of them so strong that they are not traded off for their preferred redistribution and EU integration positions, respectively. The findings shed light on trade-offs related to emerging issues such as climate change and the distinct logics behind support for radical parties. They also have implications for the electoral prospects of mainstream and radical parties when trying to reposition themselves in the diversifying issue space of contemporary democracies. As such, understanding how voters navigate issue cross-pressures helps to explain the broader dynamics that are (re)configuring political conflict and voting behavior in Europe.","tags":null,"title":"Issue trade-offs and the politics of representation: Experimental evidence from four European democracies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Breuer","Zoltan Kmetty","Mario Haim","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683212263,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683212263,"objectID":"43620a79cb63c780311a50bbaa6cb1a5","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/breuer-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-04T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breuer-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Although other social media platforms have seen a steeper increase in users recently, Facebook is still the social networking site with the largest number of users worldwide. A large number of studies from the social and behavioral sciences have investigated the antecedents, types, and consequences of its use.

However, with the drastic reduction of data access via the Facebook APIs following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this data source has essentially become unavailable to academic researchers. Hence, there is a need for different modes of data access for what Freelon (2018) has called the `post-API age'. One promising approach is to directly collaborate with platform users to ask them to share (parts of) their personal Facebook data with researchers. This paper presents experiences from two studies employing such approaches. The first used a browser plugin to unobtrusively observe Facebook use while users are active. The second asked participants to export and share parts of their personal Facebook data archive. While both approaches yield promising insights suitable to extend or replace self-reports, both also entail specific limitations.

Next, using a large survey conducted with German residents during the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 we investigate how information exposure relates to perceptions, attitudes and behaviours concerning the pandemic. Regression analyses show that getting COVID-19-related information from a multitude of sources has a statistically significant and positive relationship with public health outcomes. These findings are consistent even across the ideological left/right spectrum and party preferences. These consistent correlational results demonstrate that during the first wave of COVID-19, a uniform information environment went hand in hand with a cautious public and widely accepted mitigation measures.

We first identify websites that at least occasionally contain news items, and then analyze metrics of the news items published on these websites. We enrich the dataset with natural language processing and super- vised machine learning. We find that political news items are viewed less than non-political news items, but are shared more than one would expect based on their views. Furthermore, the source of a news item and textual features, which are often studied in clickbait research and in commercial A/B testing, matter. Our findings are conditional on age, but are very similar across four different countries (Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Poland). While our research design does not allow for causal claims, our findings suggest that future work is well-advised to both theoretically and methodologically differentiate between factors that may explain (a) viewing versus sharing of news, and (b) political versus non-political news.","tags":null,"title":"Is sharing just a function of viewing?

This study investigates these unresolved questions by combining the web browsing histories and survey responses of more than 7,000 participants from six major democracies.

Such inauthentic information campaigns threaten to undermine the Internet's promise to more equitable participation in public debates. We argue that the logic of social behavior within the campaign bureaucracy and principal-agent problems lead to detectable activity patterns among the campaign's social media accounts. Our analysis uses a network-based methodology to identify such coordination patterns in all campaigns contained in the largest publicly available database on astroturfing published by Twitter. On average, 74% of the involved accounts in each campaign engaged in a simple form of coordination that we call co-tweeting and co-retweeting. Comparing the astroturfing accounts to various systematically constructed comparison samples, we show that the same behavior is negligible among the accounts of regular users that the campaigns try to mimic. As its main substantive contribution, the paper demonstrates that online political astroturfing consistently leaves similar traces of coordination, even across diverse political and country contexts and different time periods.

Instead, these people report to pursue a passive mode of relying on specific sources, such as social media, based on the belief that 'news finds me' (NFM). Notably, the three subdimensions of NFM -- feeling informed, relying on peers, and not actively seeking news — combine intentions and perceptions related to news use. Understanding NFM perceptions, hence, requires an analytical distinction between active and passive modes of news use as reliable measures of (different types of) news use. We contribute to this field by combining a survey, tracked web-browsing data, and tracked Facebook data to investigate the relationship between NFM perceptions and exposure to online news, also taking into account political knowledge and interest as traditional predictors of active news consumption. Results show that both political knowledge and interest are associated with more news consumption via web browsers and that political knowledge—but not political interest—is also associated with more news in people’s Facebook feeds. Compared to the NFM dimensions, political knowledge and interest are stronger predictors of online news consumption in our study. Taken together, the novel combination of Facebook and web tracking data provides evidence that online news consumption is shaped by a confluence of traditional factors and more diffuse interpersonal processes.","tags":null,"title":"Do news actually 'find me'?

Building on research on the European public sphere and the politicisation of the EU, this study investigates to what extent the 2019 EP campaign was transnational and which factors were associated with 'going transnational'. It conceptualises Twitter linkages of EP candidates as constitutive elements of a transnational campaign arena distinguishing interactions with EP candidates from other countries (horizontal transnationalisation) and interactions with the supranational European party families and lead candidates (vertical transnationalisation). The analysis of tweets sent by EP candidates from all 28 member states reveals that most linkages remain national. Despite this evidence for the second-order logic, there are still relevant variations contingent on EU positions of parties, the adoption of the Spitzenkandidaten system and socialisation in the EP. The findings have implications for debates on the European public sphere and institutional reform proposals such as transnational party lists that might mitigate the EU's democratic deficit.","tags":null,"title":"Going transnational?

Recent successes of populist parties and politicians, especially in Europe and in the US, have given rise to extensive debates in the academic literature and beyond. Yet the link between populism and climate change scepticism (henceforth ‘scepticism’), has so far received little attention. This paper examines the link between scepticism and populism by means of a unique dataset: a survey and detailed web browsing histories of participants from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the US, and the UK. The web tracking data includes more than 150 million website visits over a period of three months and the survey contains questions about political attitudes and attitudes towards climate change. We analyse the 8893 websites which contained ‘climate change’ and its cognates in the URLs and link these website visits and the content of these websites to the political attitudes and climate change orientation of those who visited them. The contribution is both methodological (linking surveys and web tracking data, including cross-country comparison) and substantive (uncovering links between populists, their climate change orientations, and the content of related websites they visited). Our analysis demonstrates the value of computational methods in political communication research and provides insights into the link between populists and climate change scepticism.","tags":null,"title":"Is there a link between climate change scepticism and populism?

Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to the overall news coverage. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets are selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice at a modest level. In the majority of news articles, tweets function as an illustration of an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and – with some dependencies – the amount of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper provides evidence how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.","tags":null,"title":"Twitter in the News: An analysis of embedded tweets in political news coverage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michaela Maier","Carlos Jalali","Jürgen Maier","Alessandro Nai","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"88569af9a7d0472336815da79820cd2a","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/maier-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-07T14:57:43.466505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maier-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"European elections have been described as second-order phenomena for voters, the media, but also parties. Yet, since 2009, there exists evidence that not only voters, but also political parties assign increasing significance to European elections. While initially 'issue entrepreneurs' were held responsible for this development, the latest campaigns have raised the question of whether mainstream parties are finally also campaigning on European issues. In this article, we examine European Union (EU) salience in the 2019 European Parliament (EP) campaigns of government and opposition parties and the predictors of their strategic behaviours. We test the relevance of factors derived from the selective emphasis and the co-orientation approach within an integrated model of strategic campaign communication based on expert evaluations of 191 parties in 28 EU member states. Results show that the traditional expectation that government parties silence EU issues does not hold anymore; instead, the average EU salience of government and opposition parties is similar on the national level. The strongest predictors for a party’s decision to campaign on EU issues are the co-orientation towards the campaign agendas of competing parties, and party's EU position.","tags":null,"title":"When do parties put Europe in the centre?

This may be surprising given the potential of linking surveys and digital trace data, but at the same time, it is important to note that the collection and analysis of such linked data are challenging in several regards. The three key issues are: (1) data linking including informed consent for individual-level studies, (2) methodological and ethical issues impeding the scientific (re)analysis of linked survey and digital trace data sets, and (3) developing conceptual and theoretical frameworks tailored toward the multidimensionality of such data. This special issue addresses these challenges by presenting cutting-edge methodological work on how to best collect and analyze linked data as well as studies that have successfully combined survey data and digital trace data to find innovative answers to relevant social scientific questions.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating Survey Data and Digital Trace Data: Key Issues in Developing an Emerging Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franziska Keller","David Schoch","Sebastian Stier","JungHwan Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c88f0f618724ecced10b7358cf7a0de2","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/keller-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.466182Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keller-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without 'ground truth' information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of campaign accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.","tags":null,"title":"Political Astroturfing on Twitter: How to Coordinate a Disinformation Campaign","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Nora Kirkizh","Caterina Froio","Ralph Schroeder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9d22c6c7aab85582926bced77b9ec5f1","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.466505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Research has shown that citizens with populist attitudes evaluate the news media more negatively, and there is also suggestive evidence that they rely less on established news sources like the legacy press. However, due to data limitations, there is still no solid evidence whether populist citizens have skewed news diets in the contemporary high-choice digital media environment. In this paper, we rely on the selective exposure framework and investigate the relationship between populist attitudes and the consumption of various types of online news. To test our theoretical assumptions, we link 150 million Web site visits by 7,729 Internet users in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to their responses in an online survey. This design allows us to measure media exposure more precisely than previous studies while linking these data to demographic attributes and political attitudes of participants. The results show that populist attitudes leave pronounced marks in people’s news diets, but the evidence is heterogeneous and highly contingent on the supply side of a country's media system. Most importantly, citizens with populist attitudes visit less Web sites from the legacy press, while consuming more hyperpartisan news. Despite these tendencies, the Web tracking data show that populist citizens still primarily get their news from established sources. We discuss the implications of these results for the current state of public spheres in democracies.","tags":null,"title":"Populist attitudes and selective exposure to online news – A cross-country analysis combining web tracking and surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Besondere Prominenz in dieser Debatte hat dabei die Hypothese sogenannter 'Echokammern' gewonnen, wonach digitale Medien ihre Nutzer darin bestärken, insbesondere solche Nachrichten zu beziehen, deren politische Positionierung sie teilen, und dadurch zu einer gesellschaftlichen Polarisierung beitragen. Während Echokammern in der öffentlichen Debatte zumeist unkritisch als gegeben betrachtet werden, wird das Konzept im wissenschaftlichen Diskurs zunehmend hinterfragt. Als Herausforderungen erweisen sich dabei eine schwache theoretische Aufarbeitung des Phänomens, ein stark zersplittertes Forschungsfeld und eine mangelnde Generalisierbarkeit von Forschungsergebnissen aufgrund des primären Fokus auf den US-amerikanischen Kontext. Der vorliegende Beitrag begegnet diesen Problemstellungen und gibt einen detaillierten Überblick über das Forschungsfeld. Der Literaturüberblick trägt dabei zur theoretischen Erfassung des Untersuchungsgegenstands bei, insbesondere durch eine explizite Differenzierung zwischen Fragmentierung und Polarisierung, und berücksichtigt außerdem länderspezifische Variationen. Insgesamt kommt dieser Überblick zu dem Schluss, dass die im öffentlichen Diskurs geäußerte Furcht vor einer gesamtgesellschaftlichen Fragmentierung und damit verbundenen politischen Polarisierung empirisch nicht unterstützt wird. So ist aufbauend auf die bisherige Forschung keine Fragmentierung öffentlicher Aufmerksamkeit entlang politischer Präferenzen feststellbar. Auch auf der Wirkungsebene der Polarisierung sprechen die bisherigen Erkenntnisse gegen die vereinfachten Annahmen der Echokammer-Hypothese. Dennoch sind die bisherigen wissenschaftlichen Befunde aufgrund von Limitationen im Datenzugang noch nicht umfassend genug. Der Beitrag verdeutlicht, dass die politische Kommunikationsforschung insbesondere von innovativen, extern validen Designs und komparativer Forschung außerhalb des US-Kontexts profitieren würde.","tags":null,"title":"Die Echokammer-Hypothese: Fragmentierung der Öffentlichkeit und politische Polarisierung durch digitale Medien?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Jungherr","Ralph Schroeder","Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b7c5fb4d836887b7203be1f76722b51c","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/jungherr-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.467326Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jungherr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a recent surge of political actors and groups challenging the legitimacy of established political institutions and mass media. We argue that this wave is no accident; rather, it is driven by digital media. Digital media allow outside challengers to route around social institutions that structure political discourse, such as parties and legacy media, which have previously held a monopoly on political coordination and information distribution. Digital media have weakened the power of these institutions, allowing outsiders to maintain extreme positions that formerly would have been filtered out or suppressed by institutions structuring political discourse. In this article, we explicate mechanisms linking digital media to the rise of outsiders by discussing the successes of a diverse set of challengers fighting for attention and representation in the different political contexts of the United States, Germany, and China. We thus provide a novel explanation that systematically accounts for the political consequences of digital media.","tags":null,"title":"Digital media and the surge of political outsiders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Andreas Jungherr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a446ab72ee37102df9801b1385fc8107","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-jungherr-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.461412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-jungherr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Digitale Verhaltensdaten und Methoden der Computational Social Science in der politischen Kommunikationsforschung","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b30216cf02d033cafc8a95baa2725f86","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/publication/stier-2019-internet/","publishdate":"2020-08-07T14:57:43.461827Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stier-2019-internet/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Internetfreiheit in Europa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Becker","Marcus Müller","Wolf J.

Focusing on the German federal election campaign 2013, this article investigates whether election candidates address the topics most important to the mass audience and to which extent their communication is shaped by the characteristics of Facebook and Twitter. Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes. We relate the various findings to the mediation of political communication on social media induced by the particular characteristics of audiences and sociotechnical environments.","tags":null,"title":"Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Stier","Wolf J.

Research into resilience as the maintenance or quick recovery of mental health after major life events has so far primarily been based on panel surveys. Yet, the disadvantages of established measurements might bias results in several ways: (i) some life events are underreported due to recall bias, and the time gap between reported life events and survey participation is often unknown and varies individually, and (ii) life events themselves can lead to incomplete or missing responses.\nThis project will address both problems through an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered survey infrastructure that combines survey and web tracking data collected in the new GESIS Panel.dbd with open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we will detect the onset of major life events (e.g., health events, divorce) from web browsing behavior using theory-informed machine learning and link these measures with repeated responses to survey items from resilience research. Second, we will handle missing data in rating scales and free-text responses by building LLM-proxies that role-play a set of “characters’’ and simulate their survey responses through fine-tuning and in-context learning. Third, we will analyze resilient responses after major life events and the predictive value of psychosocial resilience factors for mental responses by comparing (i) survey-based measures used in resilience research with (ii) the augmented measures obtained from our AI-powered infrastructure. This comparison will assess the added value of our AI approach and shed light on potential biases of findings in resilience research.\nThe project is a collaboration with my GESIS colleagues Claudia Wagner and Bernd Weiß as well as the Leibniz Institute for Resilience Research (LIR). It brings together experts in survey methodology, computational social science, and resilience research to create and evaluate methodological advances to improve the quality of survey-based research in diverse disciplines.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ab21d7cdd9e1b5de7b2dc8ceaeaab80a","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/airesil/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/airesil/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Leibniz Association (2025-2027)","tags":null,"title":"Developing AI-Powered survey infrastructures to enhance resilience research","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nSummary Research on negative campaigning (NC), i.e., verbal attacks on political opponents, has gained considerable attention in recent years. Studies suggest that NC can have dysfunctional consequences for democracy (e.g. polarization, declining trust in politics). This applies in particular to negative campaign strategies that attack an opponent personally or in an uncivil manner. However, the causes and effects of NC have rarely been analyzed outside of the United States. This project, jointly led with Jürgen Maier (University of Koblenz-Landau) and Corinna Oschatz (University of Amsterdam) investigates the determinants of the use of NC in German election campaigns at the federal and state level. The aim is to test explanatory factors at the micro level (politicians who use NC) and macro factors (structural conditions during election campaigns).\nFor this purpose, we first use self-reports from candidate surveys to investigate the use and evaluation of NC by candidates. We draw on the candidate studies conducted as part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) for the 2013, 2017 and 2021 federal elections. In addition, we will invite all candidates of the relevant political parties who will take part in all of the 2021 Landtag elections to a survey. In order to measure the actual use of NC, we collect the entire social media communication of candidates and hand code a high-quality training dataset that serves as the input for machine learning models for the detection of NC at a large scale. In contrast to established sources such as party manifestos, Twitter data is available at a more fine-grained level (of the individual candidate) and in larger numbers (hundreds of thousands of posts during an election campaign, in standardized form across parties). The results from the analysis of candidate surveys and social media will be linked on the level of individual candidates.\nTaken together, the project makes an essential theoretical and empirical contribution towards a better understanding of the determinants of NC (1) over time, (2) at different federal levels and (3) depending on different individual characteristics of politicians.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c9dd699c2b31e4084ec07050fab4a4b3","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/negative-campaigning/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/negative-campaigning/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (2021-2024)","tags":null,"title":"Negative campaigning in German elections: Measurement, dynamics, and determinants","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary The online information environment provides citizens with an abundance of news and other content relevant for political opinion formation that varies considerably in terms of journalistic quality and political extremity. Politicians, journalists and academics have speculated that by facilitating individualized processes of opinion formation, the current high-choice environment of online news websites, social media and other information intermediaries is related to audience fragmentation and political polarization. Yet, research on the interplay of media exposure and dynamic polarization processes is sparse and at times contradictory. One of the reasons is that methods traditionally employed by social scientists to measure exposure such as survey-based self-reports inadequately capture online behavior.\nThis collaborative project with Katrin Weller (GESIS), Lisa Merten and Uwe Hasebrink (Leibniz-Institute for Media Research | Hans-Bredow-Institut), Juhi Kulshrestha and Cornelius Puschmann brings together techniques from computational social science with theories and methods from communication and political science. At its core is a year-long web tracking of a representative sample of approximately 1,500 German citizens from an online access panel. The participants are surveyed regularly on their demographics, political opinions, and media use and consent to having their visited websites tracked. Through web crawling and automated text analysis of those website contents we are able to measure the source, issue, and actor diversity of the information participants are exposed to and relate that to the development of their political opinions over time. With this longitudinal data, we systematically study the interplay between online information use and political opinions by statistically disentangling within-person changes. The findings have implications for academic and political debates on echo chambers, societal cohesion, and the regulation of online environments.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eb95e4c5b90612be8d26012a4e448556","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/poltrack/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/poltrack/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Leibniz Association (2022-2025)","tags":null,"title":"Political polarization and individualized online information environments: A longitudinal tracking study","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nSummary During election campaigns, many of the political messages citizens receive are negative – be it via strategic negative campaigning, media coverage or uncivil online conversations. Many studies in political communication and psychology have already focused on the effects of negativity on citizens’ reactions, e.g., attention and emotions, evaluation of politicians, or voting behavior. Most of these studies, however, investigated citizens’ political communication in isolation focusing on just one channel. Studies that focus on effects of negative information received from mass media as well as interpersonal communication environments online and offline (in the following MIC), are to the best of our knowledge non-existent – despite the obvious interactions in terms of processes and effects.\nIn addition, most studies on negativity in campaigns either focus on traditional explanations of its effects on political outcomes through survey self-reports or they try to analyze the information processing of negative information, mostly within experimental designs. It has hardly been possible to observe the effects of negativity on fast-lived variables like attention and emotions in-situ and to analyze its effects on political outcomes in an integrated research design. As a consequence, the state of research regarding the overall impact of negative political communication on important political outcomes such as evaluation of political actors, voting behavior and affective polarization so far has been fairly inconclusive.\nIn this project, jointly led with Michaela Maier (University of Koblenz-Landau) and Lukas Otto (Amsterdam School of Communication Research), we aim to comprehensively analyze the effects of negativity in MIC during election campaigns to make a fourfold contribution to the state of research: First, we examine the dynamic exposure of citizens to negative political communication in various communication environments during an election campaign. Thereby, investigating the different communication types in one research design also allows us to analyze the reciprocal relations between mediated and interpersonal communication online and offline. Second, we analyze the short-term effects of negative contents on attentional and emotional processing, and third, longer-term effects on political outcomes. By taking a longitudinal perspective, we conceptualize and measure exposure to and effects of negativity during campaigns as dynamic processes. Fourth, we methodologically contribute to the state of research by using an innovative methodology that allows us to observe the aforementioned processes in a real-world setting: we combine approaches of offline and online tracking to continuously observe citizens\u0026rsquo; engagement in political communication, surveys to assess their short-term and long-term reactions, and automated content analysis to link participants\u0026rsquo; reactions to concrete communication contents. The study will be conducted during the hot phase of the German federal election campaign in September 2021.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a06fd2a832a32a342ef6a37cb60bce4d","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/web-track/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/web-track/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (2021-2024)","tags":null,"title":"Tracking the effects of negative political communication during election campaigns in online and offline communication environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nSummary Scholars highlight several mechanisms of how digital media might benefit populists: (1) populist parties use digital media to bypass media gatekeepers that tend to obfuscate and filter their populist message; (2) social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter open up direct channels of communication between populist parties and voters/supporters, thereby bringing to life a core promise of the populist worldview; (3) social media are conducive to the spread of misinformation and disinformation that are core components in the communication strategies of populist parties; and (4) mainstream media amplify populist actors\u0026rsquo; online contents as they are reliable providers of scandals and have a massive news value.\nTogether with the other two PIs Caterina Froio (Sciences Po, Paris) and Ralph Schroeder (University of Oxford) and our respective teams, I test these theories using web browsing histories and multiple survey waves that were collected with the informed consent of more than 8,000 study participants in six countries. In addition, we collected the social media posts of a large sample of politicians and parties on Facebook and Twitter and conducted conjoint experiments. The research period captures the three months preceding the European Parliament (EP) election 2019 in six countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the U.S., which is the reference case in much of political communication research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"400022a1c007095bb693d3ef71523e13","permalink":"https://sebastianstier.com/project/online-populism/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/online-populism/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (2018-2022)","tags":null,"title":"What do 'the people' want?
