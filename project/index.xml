      <title>Negative Campaigning in German elections: Measurement, Dynamics, and Determinants</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on negative campaigning (NC), i.e. verbal attacks on political opponents, has gained considerable attention in recent years. Studies suggest that NC can have dysfunctional consequences for democracy (e.g. polarization, declining trust in politics). This applies in particular to negative campaign strategies that attack an opponent personally or in an uncivil manner. However, the causes and effects of NC have rarely been analyzed outside of the United States. This project, jointly led with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau/fb6/sowi/pw/abteilung/politische-kommunikation/team/Maier&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JÃ¼rgen Maier&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau/fb8/ikms/kompsych/oschatz-corinna&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Corinna Oschatz&lt;/a&gt; (both University of Koblenz-Landau) investigates the determinants of the use of NC in German election campaigns at the federal and state level. The aim is to test explanatory factors at the micro level (politicians who use NC) and macro factors (structural conditions during election campaigns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, we first use self-reports from candidate surveys to investigate the use and evaluation of NC by candidates. We draw on the candidate studies conducted as part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) for the 2013, 2017 and 2021 federal elections. In addition, we will invite all candidates of the relevant political parties who will take part in all of the 2021 &lt;em&gt;Landtag&lt;/em&gt; elections to a survey. In order to measure the actual use of NC, we collect the entire social media communication of candidates and hand code a high-quality training dataset that serves as the input for machine learning models for the detection of NC at a large scale. In contrast to established sources such as party manifestos, Twitter data is available at a more fine-grained level (of the individual candidate) and in larger numbers (hundreds of thousands of posts during an election campaign, in standardized form across parties). The results from the analysis of candidate surveys and social media will be linked on the level of individual candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the project makes an essential theoretical and empirical contribution towards a better understanding of the determinants of NC (1) over time, (2) at different federal levels and (3) depending on different individual characteristics of politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What do &#39;the people&#39; want? Digital Media and Populism in Europe and the U.S.</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars highlight several mechanisms of how digital media might benefit populists: (1) populist parties use digital media to bypass media gatekeepers that tend to obfuscate and filter their populist message; (2) social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter open up direct channels of communication between populist parties and voters/supporters, thereby bringing to life a core promise of the populist worldview; (3) social media are conducive to the spread of misinformation and disinformation that are core components in the communication strategies of populist parties; and (4) mainstream media amplify populist actors&#39; online contents as they are reliable providers of scandals and have a massive news value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the other two PIs 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencespo.fr/centre-etudes-europeennes/en/researcher/caterina-froio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Caterina Froio&lt;/a&gt; (Sciences Po, Paris) and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/ralph-schroeder&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ralph Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; (University of Oxford) and our respective teams, I test these theories using web browsing histories and multiple survey waves that were collected with the informed consent of more than 8,000 study participants in six countries. In addition, we collected the social media posts of a large sample of politicians and parties on Facebook and Twitter and conducted conjoint experiments. The research period captures the three months preceding the European Parliament (EP) election 2019 in six countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK and the U.S., which is the reference case in much of political communication research.&lt;/p&gt;
